# 1. **Calculate ΔM for WT and Mutants**
#    - We calculated the metabolic response difference (ΔM) by subtracting
#      the metabolite levels in the 24-hour pesticide treatment from the DMSO control.

# 2. **Scatter Plot of ΔM for WT vs Mutants**
#    - A scatter plot was generated where each point represents a metabolite,
#      with ΔM for WT on the x-axis and ΔM for mutants on the y-axis.

# 3. **Fit a line with y-intercept = 0 and slope = 1**
#    - The fitted line `y = x` (solid diagonal line) was added to the scatter plot.

# 4. **Calculate residuals from the fitted line**
#    - The residuals were computed as `residuals = delta_mutant - delta_WT`.

# 5. **Color metabolites based on residuals**
#    - **Grey:** Metabolites where residuals are within ±0.3.
#    - **Salmon:** Metabolites where residuals are outside ±0.3.

# 6. **What are these metabolites? Trends?**
#    - Outlier metabolites with large residuals were identified.
#    - A trend was observed where some metabolites had much higher ΔM in
#      mutants compared to WT (above the y=x line), while others showed 
#      the opposite (below the y=x line).
#    - This suggests that the mutant may have **deregulated** metabolism,
#      affecting specific pathways more strongly.

# 7. **Plot time-course data for 6 outlier metabolites**
#    - Time-course plots were created for 6 metabolites that had large residuals.
#    - WT and Mutant data were plotted over **0h, 8h, and 24h**.

# 8. **What do the time-course plots show?**
#    - Some metabolites show a **drastic difference** between WT and Mutant.
#    - Certain metabolites exhibit a **strong increase or decrease** over time in mutants, 
#      suggesting a mutation-driven impact on metabolism.
#    - These trends could indicate which metabolic pathways are most affected 
#      by the mutation, potentially revealing **new biological insights**.

# Proteins structures are known to be strongly connected to their functions. However, at the amino acid level, not all amino acids contribute to
# structure and function equally. Galardini and colleagues decided to investigate the impact of all possible individual, non synonymous nonsense mutations on the structure and function of protein.
# The functional impact was computed as SIFT scores and the structural impact was calculated as FoldX Score (in kCal/mol).
# Import both sift and foldx datasets;
sift_dataset = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/main/R/datasets/sift.tsv'

# In both datasets, create a column specific_Protein_aa which will be a cantenation of the Protein and Amino_acid columns such that If you have Protein A5A607 and Amino_acid E63D, you have specific_Protein_aa A5A607_E63D
sift_dataset1$specific_Protein_aa <- paste(sift_dataset1$Protein, sift_dataset1$Amino_Acid, sep = "_")
foldx_dataset1$specific_Protein_aa <- paste(foldx_dataset1$Protein, foldx_dataset1$Amino_Acid, sep = "_")
# Using the specific_Protein_aa column, merge sift and foldx dataset into one final dataframe.
new_mergeddata <- sift_dataset1 %>%
  dplyr::left_join(foldx_dataset1, by = join_by(specific_Protein_aa))
# According to the authors;A SIFT Score below 0.05 is deleterious and A FoldX score greater than
# 2 kCal/mol is deleterious. Using the criteria above, Find all mutations that have a SIFT score below 0.05 and FoldX Score above 2
# (i.e: Mutations that affect both structure and function)
# Filter mutations that meet the deleterious criteria
deleterious_mutations <- subset(new_mergeddata, sift_Score< 0.05 & foldX_Score > 2)
# Print the result
print(deleterious_mutations)
# Study the amino acid substitution nomenclature
# Investigate for the amino acid that has the most functional and structural impact.
# Hint: Using the amino acid column, find a way to select the first amino acid. Solution here.Generate a frequency table for all the amino acids. Use table() to get the frequency table
# Extract the first amino acid from the Mutation column
deleterious_mutations$AA <- substr(deleterious_mutations$Amino_Acid.x, 1, 1)
# Generate a frequency table for the first amino acids
aa_frequency <- table(deleterious_mutations$AA)
# Print the frequency table
print(aa_frequency)
# Using the amino frequency table above, generate a barplot and pie chart to represent the frequency of the amino acids.
barplot(aa_frequency,col=aa_frequency)
pie(aa_frequency,col=aa_frequency)
# Briefly describe the amino acid with the highest impact on protein structure and function
# Glycine (Gly/G) is the amino acid with the shortest side chain, having an R-group consistent only of a single hydrogen. 
# As a result, glycine is the only amino acid that is not chiral. Its small side chain allows it to readily fit into both hydrophobic
#and hydrophilic environments.This allows for greater flexibility in protein folding and enables it to fit into tight spaces within a protein structure that other amino acids cannot.
# What can you say about the structural property and functional property of amino acids with more than 100 occurences.
# Amino acids with more than 100 occurrences play crucial structural and functional roles: hydrophobic residues
# (A, F, I, L, V, W) stabilize protein cores, while flexible residues (G, P) influence loops and turns, and polar/charged residues (D, Q, R, S, T, Y) contribute to enzymatic activity
# and interactions. Functionally, these amino acids are essential for protein folding, stability, binding interactions, and post-translational modifications, making them critical for both structure and function.

##NHANES is a program run by the CDC to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US.
##It combines survey questions and physical examinations, including medical and physiological measurements and laboratory tests,
##and examines a representative sample of about 5,000 people each year. The data is used to determine the prevalence of diseases and risk factors, establish national standards, and support epidemiology studies and health sciences research.
